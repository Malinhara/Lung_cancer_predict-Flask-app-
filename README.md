Lung Cancer Prediction Flask App
Overview
This repository contains a Flask web application for predicting lung cancer using a machine learning model. The model is built using the Random Forest classifier algorithm and is trained on a dataset containing various features relevant to lung cancer diagnosis.

Features
Lung Cancer Prediction: The app predicts the likelihood of lung cancer based on input features such as age, smoking history, and other medical parameters.
User-friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface allows users to input data and get predictions easily.
Machine Learning: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for accurate and reliable predictions.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing features such as age, gender, smoking history, and other medical factors. The dataset is preprocessed and used to train a Random Forest classifier, which forms the basis of the prediction model.

Model
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: [Include accuracy if known]
